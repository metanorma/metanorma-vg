[[section1]]
== Introduction

=== General

Electronic address books have become ubiquitous.  Their increased
presence on portable, connected devices as well as the diversity of
platforms that exchange contact data call for a standard.  This memo
defines the vCard format, which allows the capture and exchange of
information normally stored within an address book or directory
application.

A high-level overview of the differences from <<RFC2425>> and <<RFC2426>> can
be found in <<appendixA>>.

=== Conventions

The key words "[keyword]#MUST#", "[keyword]#MUST NOT#", "[keyword]#REQUIRED#", "[keyword]#SHALL#", "[keyword]#SHALL NOT#",
"[keyword]#SHOULD#", "[keyword]#SHOULD NOT#", "[keyword]#RECOMMENDED#", "[keyword]#NOT RECOMMENDED#", "[keyword]#MAY#", and
"[keyword]#OPTIONAL#" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
<<RFC2119>>.

== Scope
This document defines the vCard data format for representing and
exchanging a variety of information about individuals and other
entities (e.g., formatted and structured name and delivery addresses,
email address, multiple telephone numbers, photograph, logo, audio
clips, etc.).  This document obsoletes <<RFC2425>>, <<RFC2426>>, and <<RFC4770>>, and
updates <<RFC2739>>.

== Terms and Definitions

[[section3]]
== vCard Format Specification

=== General

The text/vcard MIME content type (hereafter known as "vCard"; see
<<section10_1>>) contains contact information, typically pertaining to a
single contact or group of contacts.  The content consists of one or
more lines in the format given below.

[[section3_1]]
=== Charset

The charset (see <<RFC3536>> for internationalization terminology) for
vCard is UTF-8 as defined in <<RFC3629>>.  There is no way to override
this.  It is invalid to specify a value other than "UTF-8" in the
"charset" MIME parameter (see <<section10_1>>).

[[section3_2]]
===  Line Delimiting and Folding

Individual lines within vCard are delimited by the <<RFC5322>> line
break, which is a CRLF sequence (U+000D followed by U+000A).  Long
logical lines of text can be split into a multiple-physical-line
representation using the following folding technique.  Content lines
[keyword]#SHOULD# be folded to a maximum width of 75 octets, excluding the line
break.  Multi-octet characters [keyword]#MUST# remain contiguous.  The rationale
for this folding process can be found in <<RFC5322,section 2.1.1>>.

A logical line [keyword]#MAY# be continued on the next physical line anywhere
between two characters by inserting a CRLF immediately followed by a
single white space character (space (U+0020) or horizontal tab
(U+0009)).  The folded line [keyword]#MUST# contain at least one character.  Any
sequence of CRLF followed immediately by a single white space
character is ignored (removed) when processing the content type.  For
example, the line:

....
  NOTE:This is a long description that exists on a long line.
....

can be represented as:

....
  NOTE:This is a long description
    that exists on a long line.
....

It could also be represented as:

....
  NOTE:This is a long descrip
   tion that exists o
   n a long line.
....

The process of moving from this folded multiple-line representation
of a property definition to its single-line representation is called
unfolding.  Unfolding is accomplished by regarding CRLF immediately
followed by a white space character (namely, HTAB (U+0009) or SPACE
(U+0020)) as equivalent to no characters at all (i.e., the CRLF and
single white space character are removed).

NOTE: It is possible for very simple implementations to generate
improperly folded lines in the middle of a UTF-8 multi-octet
sequence.  For this reason, implementations [keyword]#SHOULD# unfold lines in
such a way as to properly restore the original sequence.

NOTE: Unfolding is done differently than in <<RFC5322>>.  Unfolding
in <<RFC5322>> only removes the CRLF, not the space following it.

Folding is done after any content encoding of a type value.
Unfolding is done before any decoding of a type value in a content
line.

[[section3_3]]
=== ABNF Format Definition

The following ABNF uses the notation of <<RFC5234>>, which also defines
CRLF, WSP, DQUOTE, VCHAR, ALPHA, and DIGIT.

[source,abnf]
----
vcard-entity = 1*vcard

vcard = "BEGIN:VCARD" CRLF
        "VERSION:4.0" CRLF
        1*contentline
        "END:VCARD" CRLF
  ; A vCard object MUST include the VERSION and FN properties.
  ; VERSION MUST come immediately after BEGIN:VCARD.

contentline = [group "."] name *(";" param) ":" value CRLF
  ; When parsing a content line, folded lines must first
  ; be unfolded according to the unfolding procedure
  ; described in Section 3.2.
  ; When generating a content line, lines longer than 75
  ; characters SHOULD be folded according to the folding
  ; procedure described in Section 3.2.

group = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-")
name  = "SOURCE" / "KIND" / "FN" / "N" / "NICKNAME"
      / "PHOTO" / "BDAY" / "ANNIVERSARY" / "GENDER" / "ADR" / "TEL"
      / "EMAIL" / "IMPP" / "LANG" / "TZ" / "GEO" / "TITLE" / "ROLE"
      / "LOGO" / "ORG" / "MEMBER" / "RELATED" / "CATEGORIES"
      / "NOTE" / "PRODID" / "REV" / "SOUND" / "UID" / "CLIENTPIDMAP"
      / "URL" / "KEY" / "FBURL" / "CALADRURI" / "CALURI" / "XML"
      / iana-token / x-name
  ; Parsing of the param and value is based on the "name" as
  ; defined in ABNF sections below.
  ; Group and name are case-insensitive.

iana-token = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-")
  ; identifier registered with IANA

x-name = "x-" 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-")
  ; Names that begin with "x-" or "X-" are
  ; reserved for experimental use, not intended for released
  ; products, or for use in bilateral agreements.

param = language-param / value-param / pref-param / pid-param
      / type-param / geo-parameter / tz-parameter / sort-as-param
      / calscale-param / any-param
  ; Allowed parameters depend on property name.

param-value = *SAFE-CHAR / DQUOTE *QSAFE-CHAR DQUOTE

any-param  = (iana-token / x-name) "=" param-value *("," param-value)

NON-ASCII = UTF8-2 / UTF8-3 / UTF8-4
  ; UTF8-{2,3,4} are defined in IETF RFC 3629

QSAFE-CHAR = WSP / "!" / %x23-7E / NON-ASCII
  ; Any character except CTLs, DQUOTE

SAFE-CHAR = WSP / "!" / %x23-39 / %x3C-7E / NON-ASCII
  ; Any character except CTLs, DQUOTE, ";", ":"

VALUE-CHAR = WSP / VCHAR / NON-ASCII
  ; Any textual character
----

A line that begins with a white space character is a continuation of
the previous line, as described in <<section3_2>>.  The white space
character and immediately preceeding CRLF should be discarded when
reconstructing the original line.  Note that this line-folding
convention differs from that found in <<RFC5322>>, in that the sequence
<CRLF><WSP> found anywhere in the content indicates a continued line
and should be removed.

Property names and parameter names are case-insensitive (e.g., the
property name "fn" is the same as "FN" and "Fn").  Parameter values
[keyword]#MAY# be case-sensitive or case-insensitive, depending on their
definition.  Parameter values that are not explicitly defined as
being case-sensitive are case-insensitive.  Based on experience with
vCard 3 interoperability, it is [keyword]#RECOMMENDED# that property and
parameter names be upper-case on output.

The group construct is used to group related properties together.
The group name is a syntactic convention used to indicate that all
property names prefaced with the same group name [keyword]#SHOULD# be grouped
together when displayed by an application.  It has no other
significance.  Implementations that do not understand or support
grouping [keyword]#MAY# simply strip off any text before a "." to the left of
the type name and present the types and values as normal.

Property cardinalities are indicated using the following notation,
which is based on ABNF (see <<RFC5234,section 3.6>>):

|===
| Cardinality | Meaning                                         

|      1      | Exactly one instance per vCard [keyword]#MUST# be present.  
|      *1     | Exactly one instance per vCard [keyword]#MAY# be present.   
|      1*     | One or more instances per vCard [keyword]#MUST# be present. 
|      *      | One or more instances per vCard [keyword]#MAY# be present.  
|===

Properties defined in a vCard instance may have multiple values
depending on the property cardinality.  The general rule for encoding
multi-valued properties is to simply create a new content line for
each value (including the property name).  However, it should be
noted that some value types support encoding multiple values in a
single content line by separating the values with a comma ",".  This
approach has been taken for several of the content types defined
below (date, time, integer, float).

[[section3_4]]
===  Property Value Escaping

Some properties may contain one or more values delimited by a COMMA
character (U+002C).  Therefore, a COMMA character in a value [keyword]#MUST# be
escaped with a BACKSLASH character (U+005C), even for properties that
don't allow multiple instances (for consistency).

Some properties (e.g., N and ADR) comprise multiple fields delimited
by a SEMICOLON character (U+003B).  Therefore, a SEMICOLON in a field
of such a "compound" property [keyword]#MUST# be escaped with a BACKSLASH
character.  SEMICOLON characters in non-compound properties [keyword]#MAY# be
escaped.  On input, an escaped SEMICOLON character is never a field
separator.  An unescaped SEMICOLON character may be a field
separator, depending on the property in which it appears.

Furthermore, some fields of compound properties may contain a list of
values delimited by a COMMA character.  Therefore, a COMMA character
in one of a field's values [keyword]#MUST# be escaped with a BACKSLASH
character, even for fields that don't allow multiple values (for
consistency).  Compound properties allowing multiple instances [keyword]#MUST NOT#
be encoded in a single content line.

Finally, BACKSLASH characters in values [keyword]#MUST# be escaped with a
BACKSLASH character.  NEWLINE (U+000A) characters in values [keyword]#MUST# be
encoded by two characters: a BACKSLASH followed by either an 'n'
(U+006E) or an 'N' (U+004E).

In all other cases, escaping [keyword]#MUST NOT# be used.

[[section4]]
==  Property Value Data Types

                 ; document.
----

[[section4_1]]
===  TEXT

"text": The "text" value type should be used to identify values that
contain human-readable text.  As for the language, it is controlled
by the LANGUAGE property parameter defined in <<section5_1>>.

Examples for "text":

....
    this is a text value
    this is one value,this is another
    this is a single value\, with a comma encoded
....

A formatted text line break in a text value type [keyword]#MUST# be represented
as the character sequence backslash (U+005C) followed by a Latin
small letter n (U+006E) or a Latin capital letter N (U+004E), that
is, "\n" or "\N".

For example, a multiple line NOTE value of:

....
    Mythical Manager
    Hyjinx Software Division
    BabsCo, Inc.
....

could be represented as:

....
    NOTE:Mythical Manager\nHyjinx Software Division\n
     BabsCo\, Inc.\n
....

demonstrating the \n literal formatted line break technique, the
CRLF-followed-by-space line folding technique, and the backslash
escape technique.

[[section4_2]]
===  URI

"uri": The "uri" value type should be used to identify values that
are referenced by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) instead of
encoded in-line.  These value references might be used if the value
is too large, or otherwise undesirable to include directly.  The
format for the URI is as defined in <<RFC3986,section 3>>.  Note
that the value of a property of type "uri" is what the URI points to,
not the URI itself.

Examples for "uri":

....
    http://www.example.com/my/picture.jpg
    ldap://ldap.example.com/cn=babs%20jensen
....

[[section4_3]]
===  DATE, TIME, DATE-TIME, DATE-AND-OR-TIME, and TIMESTAMP

==== General

"date", "time", "date-time", "date-and-or-time", and "timestamp":
Each of these value types is based on the definitions in
<<ISO8601>>.  Multiple such values can be specified using the
comma-separated notation.

Only the basic format is supported.

[[section4_3_1]]
====  DATE

A calendar date as specified in <<ISO8601,clause 4.1.2>>].

Reduced accuracy, as specified in <<ISO8601,clause 4.1.2.3>> a)
and b), but not c), is permitted.

Expanded representation, as specified in <<ISO8601,clause 4.1.4>>, is forbidden.

Truncated representation, as specified in <<ISO8601,clause 5.2.1.3>> d), e), and f), is permitted.

Examples for "date":

....
          19850412
          1985-04
          1985
          --0412
          ---12
          
          
          
....

Note the use of YYYY-MM in the second example above.  YYYYMM is
disallowed to prevent confusion with YYMMDD.  Note also that
YYYY-MM-DD is disallowed since we are using the basic format instead
of the extended format.

[[section4_3_2]]
====  TIME

A time of day as specified in <<ISO8601,clause 4.2>>.

Reduced accuracy, as specified in <<ISO8601,clause 4.2.2.3>>,
is permitted.

Representation with decimal fraction, as specified in
<<ISO8601,clause 4.2.2.4>>, is forbidden.

The midnight hour is always represented by 00, never 24 (see
<<ISO8601,clause 4.2.3>>).

Truncated representation, as specified in <<ISO8601.2000,clause 5.3.1.4>> a), b), and c), is permitted.

Examples for "time":

....
          102200
          1022
          10
          -2200
          --00
          102200Z
          102200-0800
....

[[section4_3_3]]
====  DATE-TIME

A date and time of day combination as specified in <<ISO8601,clause 4.3>>.

Truncation of the date part, as specified in <<ISO8601.2000,clause 5.4.2>> c), is permitted.

Examples for "date-time":

....
          19961022T140000
          --1022T1400
          ---22T14
....

[[section4_3_4]]
====  DATE-AND-OR-TIME

Either a DATE-TIME, a DATE, or a TIME value.  To allow unambiguous
interpretation, a stand-alone TIME value is always preceded by a "T".

Examples for "date-and-or-time":

....
          19961022T140000
          --1022T1400
          ---22T14
          19850412
          1985-04
          1985
          --0412
          ---12
          T102200
          T1022
          T10
          T-2200
          T--00
          T102200Z
          T102200-0800
....

[[section4_3_5]]
====  TIMESTAMP

A complete date and time of day combination as specified in
<<ISO8601,clause 4.3.2>>.

Examples for "timestamp":

....
          19961022T140000
          19961022T140000Z
          19961022T140000-05
          19961022T140000-0500
....

[[section4_4]]
===  BOOLEAN

"boolean": The "boolean" value type is used to express boolean
values.  These values are case-insensitive.

Examples: ::
....
    TRUE
    false
    True
....


[[section4_5]]
===  INTEGER

"integer": The "integer" value type is used to express signed
integers in decimal format.  If sign is not specified, the value is
assumed positive "+".  Multiple "integer" values can be specified
using the comma-separated notation.  The maximum value is
9223372036854775807, and the minimum value is -9223372036854775808.
These limits correspond to a signed 64-bit integer using two's-
complement arithmetic.

Examples: ::
....
    1234567890
    -1234556790
    +1234556790,432109876
....

[[section4_6]]
===  FLOAT

"float": The "float" value type is used to express real numbers.  If
sign is not specified, the value is assumed positive "+".  Multiple
"float" values can be specified using the comma-separated notation.
Implementations [keyword]#MUST# support a precision equal or better than that of
the IEEE "binary64" format <<IEEE754>>.

Note: Scientific notation is disallowed.  Implementers wishing to
use their favorite language's %f formatting should be careful.

Examples: ::
....
    20.30
    1000000.0000001
    1.333,3.14
....

[[section4_7]]
===  UTC-OFFSET

"utc-offset": The "utc-offset" value type specifies that the property
value is a signed offset from UTC.  This value type can be specified
in the TZ property.

The value type is an offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
It is specified as a positive or negative difference in units of
hours and minutes (e.g., +hhmm).  The time is specified as a 24-hour
clock.  Hour values are from 00 to 23, and minute values are from 00
to 59.  Hour and minutes are 2 digits with high-order zeroes required
to maintain digit count.  The basic format for ISO 8601 UTC offsets
[keyword]#MUST# be used.

[[section4_8]]
===  LANGUAGE-TAG

"language-tag": A single language tag, as defined in <<RFC5646>>.

[[section5]]
==  Property Parameters
=== General

A property can have attributes associated with it.  These "property
parameters" contain meta-information about the property or the
property value.  In some cases, the property parameter can be multi-
valued in which case the property parameter value elements are
separated by a COMMA (U+002C).

Property parameter value elements that contain the COLON (U+003A),
SEMICOLON (U+003B), or COMMA (U+002C) character separators [keyword]#MUST# be
specified as quoted-string text values.  Property parameter values
[keyword]#MUST NOT# contain the DQUOTE (U+0022) character.  The DQUOTE character
is used as a delimiter for parameter values that contain restricted
characters or URI text.

Applications [keyword]#MUST# ignore x-param and iana-param values they don't
recognize.

[[section5_1]]
=== LANGUAGE

The LANGUAGE property parameter is used to identify data in multiple
languages.  There is no concept of "default" language, except as
specified by any "Content-Language" MIME header parameter that is
present <<RFC3282>>.  The value of the LANGUAGE property parameter is a
language tag as defined in <<RFC5646,section 2>>.

Examples: ::
....
  ROLE;LANGUAGE=tr:hoca
....

ABNF: ::
[source,abnf]
----
        language-param = "LANGUAGE=" Language-Tag
          ; Language-Tag is defined in section 2.1 of IETF RFC 5646
          
----

[[section5_2]]
===  VALUE

The VALUE parameter is [keyword]#OPTIONAL#, used to identify the value type
(data type) and format of the value.  The use of these predefined
formats is encouraged even if the value parameter is not explicitly
used.  By defining a standard set of value types and their formats,
existing parsing and processing code can be leveraged.  The
predefined data type values [keyword]#MUST NOT# be repeated in COMMA-separated
value lists except within the N, NICKNAME, ADR, and CATEGORIES
properties.

ABNF: ::
[source,abnf]
----
  value-param = "VALUE=" value-type

  value-type = "text"
             / "uri"

===  PREF

The PREF parameter is [keyword]#OPTIONAL# and is used to indicate that the
corresponding instance of a property is preferred by the vCard
author.  Its value [keyword]#MUST# be an integer between 1 and 100 that
quantifies the level of preference.  Lower values correspond to a
higher level of preference, with 1 being most preferred.

When the parameter is absent, the default [keyword]#MUST# be to interpret the
property instance as being least preferred.

Note that the value of this parameter is to be interpreted only in
relation to values assigned to other instances of the same property
in the same vCard.  A given value, or the absence of a value, [keyword]#MUST NOT#
be interpreted on its own.

This parameter [keyword]#MAY# be applied to any property that allows multiple
instances.

ABNF: ::
[source,abnf]
----
        pref-param = "PREF=" (1*2DIGIT / "100")
                             ; An integer between 1 and 100.
----


[[section5_4]]
===  ALTID

The ALTID parameter is used to "tag" property instances as being
alternative representations of the same logical property.  For
example, translations of a property in multiple languages generates
multiple property instances having different LANGUAGE (<<section5_1>>)
parameter that are tagged with the same ALTID value.

This parameter's value is treated as an opaque string.  Its sole
purpose is to be compared for equality against other ALTID parameter
values.

Two property instances are considered alternative representations of
the same logical property if and only if their names as well as the
value of their ALTID parameters are identical.  Property instances
without the ALTID parameter [keyword]#MUST NOT# be considered an alternative
representation of any other property instance.  Values for the ALTID
parameter are not globally unique: they [keyword]#MAY# be reused for different
property names.

Property instances having the same ALTID parameter value count as 1
toward cardinality.  Therefore, since N (<<section6_2_2>>) has
cardinality *1 and TITLE (<<section6_6_1>>) has cardinality *, these
three examples would be legal:

....
  N;ALTID=1;LANGUAGE=jp:<U+5C71><U+7530>;<U+592A><U+90CE>;;;
  N;ALTID=1;LANGUAGE=en:Yamada;Taro;;;
  (<U+XXXX> denotes a UTF8-encoded Unicode character.)
....

....
  TITLE;ALTID=1;LANGUAGE=fr:Patron
  TITLE;ALTID=1;LANGUAGE=en:Boss
....

....
  TITLE;ALTID=1;LANGUAGE=fr:Patron
  TITLE;ALTID=1;LANGUAGE=en:Boss
  TITLE;ALTID=2;LANGUAGE=en:Chief vCard Evangelist
....

while this one would not:

....
  N;ALTID=1;LANGUAGE=jp:<U+5C71><U+7530>;<U+592A><U+90CE>;;;
  N:Yamada;Taro;;;
  (Two instances of the N property.)
....

and these three would be legal but questionable:

....
  TITLE;ALTID=1;LANGUAGE=fr:Patron
  TITLE;ALTID=2;LANGUAGE=en:Boss
  (Should probably have the same ALTID value.)
....

....
  TITLE;ALTID=1;LANGUAGE=fr:Patron
  TITLE:LANGUAGE=en:Boss
  (Second line should probably have ALTID=1.)
....

....
  N;ALTID=1;LANGUAGE=jp:<U+5C71><U+7530>;<U+592A><U+90CE>;;;
  N;ALTID=1;LANGUAGE=en:Yamada;Taro;;;
  N;ALTID=1;LANGUAGE=en:Smith;John;;;
  (The last line should probably have ALTID=2.  But that would be
   illegal because N has cardinality *1.)
....

The ALTID property [keyword]#MAY# also be used in may contexts other than with
the LANGUAGE parameter.  Here's an example with two representations
of the same photo in different file formats:

....
  PHOTO;ALTID=1:data:image/jpeg;base64,...
  PHOTO;ALTID=1;data:image/jp2;base64,...
  
  
  
....

ABNF: ::

----
        altid-param = "ALTID=" param-value

[[section5_5]]
===  PID

The PID parameter is used to identify a specific property among
multiple instances.  It plays a role analogous to the UID property
(<<section6_7_6>>) on a per-property instead of per-vCard basis.  It [keyword]#MAY#
appear more than once in a given property.  It [keyword]#MUST NOT# appear on
properties that may have only one instance per vCard.  Its value is
either a single small positive integer or a pair of small positive
integers separated by a dot.  Multiple values may be encoded in a
single PID parameter by separating the values with a comma ",".  See
<<section7>> for more details on its usage.

ABNF: ::
[source,abnf]
----
        pid-param = "PID=" pid-value *("," pid-value)
        pid-value = 1*DIGIT ["." 1*DIGIT]
----

[[section5_6]]
===  TYPE

The TYPE parameter has multiple, different uses.  In general, it is a
way of specifying class characteristics of the associated property.
Most of the time, its value is a comma-separated subset of a
predefined enumeration.  In this document, the following properties
make use of this parameter: FN, NICKNAME, PHOTO, ADR, TEL, EMAIL,
IMPP, LANG, TZ, GEO, TITLE, ROLE, LOGO, ORG, RELATED, CATEGORIES,
NOTE, SOUND, URL, KEY, FBURL, CALADRURI, and CALURI.  The TYPE
parameter [keyword]#MUST NOT# be applied on other properties defined in this
document.

The "work" and "home" values act like tags.  The "work" value implies
that the property is related to an individual's work place, while the
"home" value implies that the property is related to an individual's
personal life.  When neither "work" nor "home" is present, it is
implied that the property is related to both an individual's work
place and personal life in the case that the KIND property's value is
"individual", or to none in other cases.

ABNF: ::
[source,abnf]
----
       type-param = "TYPE=" type-value *("," type-value)

        type-value = "work" / "home" / type-param-tel
                   / type-param-related / iana-token / x-name
          ; This is further defined in individual property sections.
----

[[section5_7]]
===  MEDIATYPE

The MEDIATYPE parameter is used with properties whose value is a URI.
Its use is [keyword]#OPTIONAL#.  It provides a hint to the vCard consumer
application about the media type <<RFC2046>> of the resource identified
by the URI.  Some URI schemes do not need this parameter.  For
example, the "data" scheme allows the media type to be explicitly
indicated as part of the URI <<RFC2397>>.  Another scheme, "http",
provides the media type as part of the URI resolution process, with
the Content-Type HTTP header <<RFC2616>>.  The MEDIATYPE parameter is
intended to be used with URI schemes that do not provide such
functionality (e.g., "ftp" <<RFC1738>>).

ABNF: ::
[source,abnf]
----
  mediatype-param = "MEDIATYPE=" mediatype
  mediatype = type-name "/" subtype-name *( ";" attribute "=" value )
    ; "attribute" and "value" are from IETF RFC 2045
    ; "type-name" and "subtype-name" are from [RFC4288]
----

[[section5_8]]
===  CALSCALE

The CALSCALE parameter is identical to the CALSCALE property in
iCalendar (see <<RFC5545,section 3.7.1>>).  It is used to define the
calendar system in which a date or date-time value is expressed.  The
only value specified by iCalendar is "gregorian", which stands for
the Gregorian system.  It is the default when the parameter is
absent.  Additional values may be defined in extension documents and
registered with IANA (see <<section10_3_4>>).  A vCard implementation
[keyword]#MUST# ignore properties with a CALSCALE parameter value that it does
not understand.

ABNF: ::
[source,abnf]
----
        calscale-param = "CALSCALE=" calscale-value

        calscale-value = "gregorian" / iana-token / x-name
----

[[section5_9]]
===  SORT-AS

The "sort-as" parameter is used to specify the string to be used for
national-language-specific sorting.  Without this information,
sorting algorithms could incorrectly sort this vCard within a
sequence of sorted vCards.  When this property is present in a vCard,
then the given strings are used for sorting the vCard.

This parameter's value is a comma-separated list that [keyword]#MUST# have as
many or fewer elements as the corresponding property value has
components.  This parameter's value is case-sensitive.

ABNF: ::
[source,abnf]
----
  sort-as-param = "SORT-AS=" sort-as-value

  sort-as-value = param-value *("," param-value)
----

Examples: For the case of surname and given name sorting, the
following examples define common sort string usage with the N
property.

....
        FN:Rene van der Harten
        N;SORT-AS="Harten,Rene":van der Harten;Rene,J.;Sir;R.D.O.N.
....

....
        FN:Robert Pau Shou Chang
        N;SORT-AS="Pau Shou Chang,Robert":Shou Chang;Robert,Pau;;
....

....
        FN:Osamu Koura
        N;SORT-AS="Koura,Osamu":Koura;Osamu;;
....

....
        FN:Oscar del Pozo
        N;SORT-AS="Pozo,Oscar":del Pozo Triscon;Oscar;;
....

....
        FN:Chistine d'Aboville
        N;SORT-AS="Aboville,Christine":d'Aboville;Christine;;
....

....
        FN:H. James de Mann
        N;SORT-AS="Mann,James":de Mann;Henry,James;;
....

If sorted by surname, the results would be:

....
        Christine d'Aboville
        Rene van der Harten
        Osamu Koura
        H. James de Mann
        Robert Pau Shou Chang
        Oscar del Pozo
....

If sorted by given name, the results would be:

....
        Christine d'Aboville
        H. James de Mann
        Osamu Koura
        Oscar del Pozo
        Rene van der Harten
        Robert Pau Shou Chang
....

[[section5_10]]
===  GEO

The GEO parameter can be used to indicate global positioning
information that is specific to an address.  Its value is the same as
that of the GEO property (see <<section6_5_2>>).

ABNF: ::
[source,abnf]
----
  geo-parameter = "GEO=" DQUOTE URI DQUOTE

==  vCard Properties
=== General

What follows is an enumeration of the standard vCard properties.

[[section6_1]]
===  General Properties

[[section6_1_1]]
====  BEGIN

Purpose: :: To denote the beginning of a syntactic entity within a
   text/vcard content-type.

Value type: :: text

Cardinality: :: 1

Special notes: :: The content entity [keyword]#MUST# begin with the BEGIN property
   with a value of "VCARD".  The value is case-insensitive.
+
The BEGIN property is used in conjunction with the END property to
   delimit an entity containing a related set of properties within a
   text/vcard content-type.  This construct can be used instead of
   including multiple vCards as body parts inside of a multipart/
   alternative MIME message.  It is provided for applications that
   wish to define content that can contain multiple entities within
   the same text/vcard content-type or to define content that can be
   identifiable outside of a MIME environment.

ABNF: ::
+
[source,abnf]
----
  BEGIN-param = 0" "  ; no parameter allowed
  BEGIN-value = "VCARD"
----

Example: ::
+
....
      BEGIN:VCARD
....

[[section6_1_2]]
====  END

Purpose: :: To denote the end of a syntactic entity within a text/vcard
   content-type.

Value type: :: text

Cardinality: :: 1

Special notes: :: The content entity [keyword]#MUST# end with the END type with a
   value of "VCARD".  The value is case-insensitive.
+
The END property is used in conjunction with the BEGIN property to
   delimit an entity containing a related set of properties within a
   text/vcard content-type.  This construct can be used instead of or
   in addition to wrapping separate sets of information inside
   additional MIME headers.  It is provided for applications that
   wish to define content that can contain multiple entities within
   the same text/vcard content-type or to define content that can be
   identifiable outside of a MIME environment.

ABNF: ::
+
[source,abnf]
----
  END-param = 0" "  ; no parameter allowed
  END-value = "VCARD"
----

Example: ::
....
      END:VCARD
....

[[section6_1_3]]
====  SOURCE

Purpose: :: To identify the source of directory information contained
   in the content type.

Value type: :: uri

Cardinality: :: *

Special notes: :: The SOURCE property is used to provide the means by
   which applications knowledgable in the given directory service
   protocol can obtain additional or more up-to-date information from
   the directory service.  It contains a URI as defined in <<RFC3986>>
   and/or other information referencing the vCard to which the
   information pertains.  When directory information is available
   from more than one source, the sending entity can pick what it
   considers to be the best source, or multiple SOURCE properties can
   be included.

ABNF: ::

[source,abnf]
----
  SOURCE-param = "VALUE=uri" / pid-param / pref-param / altid-param
               / mediatype-param / any-param

....

[[section6_1_4]]
====  KIND

Purpose: :: To specify the kind of object the vCard represents.

Value type: :: A single text value.

Cardinality: :: *1

Special notes: :: The value may be one of the following:
+
"individual" :: for a vCard representing a single person or entity.
      This is the default kind of vCard.
      
"group" :: for a vCard representing a group of persons or entities.
      The group's member entities can be other vCards or other types
      of entities, such as email addresses or web sites.  A group
      vCard will usually contain MEMBER properties to specify the
      members of the group, but it is not required to.  A group vCard
      without MEMBER properties can be considered an abstract
      grouping, or one whose members are known empirically (perhaps
      "IETF Participants" or "Republican U.S. Senators").
+
All properties in a group vCard apply to the group as a whole,
      and not to any particular MEMBER.  For example, an EMAIL
      property might specify the address of a mailing list associated
      with the group, and an IMPP property might refer to a group
      chat room.
"org" :: for a vCard representing an organization.  An organization
      vCard will not (in fact, [keyword]#MUST NOT#) contain MEMBER properties,
      and so these are something of a cross between "individual" and
      "group".  An organization is a single entity, but not a person.
      It might represent a business or government, a department or
      division within a business or government, a club, an
      association, or the like.
+
All properties in an organization vCard apply to the
      organization as a whole, as is the case with a group vCard.
      For example, an EMAIL property might specify the address of a
      contact point for the organization.
      
"location" :: for a named geographical place.  A location vCard will
      usually contain a GEO property, but it is not required to.  A
      location vCard without a GEO property can be considered an
      abstract location, or one whose definition is known empirically
      (perhaps "New England" or "The Seashore").
+
All properties in a location vCard apply to the location
      itself, and not with any entity that might exist at that
      location.  For example, in a vCard for an office building, an
      ADR property might give the mailing address for the building,
      and a TEL property might specify the telephone number of the
      receptionist.
An x-name. :: vCards [keyword]#MAY# include private or experimental values for
      KIND.  Remember that x-name values are not intended for general
      use and are unlikely to interoperate.
An iana-token. :: Additional values may be registered with IANA (see
      <<section10_3_4>>).  A new value's specification document [keyword]#MUST#
      specify which properties make sense for that new kind of vCard
      and which do not.

Implementations [keyword]#MUST# support the specific string values defined
   above.  If this property is absent, "individual" [keyword]#MUST# be assumed
   as the default.  If this property is present but the
   implementation does not understand its value (the value is an
   x-name or iana-token that the implementation does not support),
   the implementation [keyword]#SHOULD# act in a neutral way, which usually
   means treating the vCard as though its kind were "individual".
   The presence of MEMBER properties [keyword]#MAY#, however, be taken as an
   indication that the unknown kind is an extension of "group".

Clients often need to visually distinguish contacts based on what
   they represent, and the KIND property provides a direct way for
   them to do so.  For example, when displaying contacts in a list,
   an icon could be displayed next to each one, using distinctive
   icons for the different kinds; a client might use an outline of a
   single person to represent an "individual", an outline of multiple
   people to represent a "group", and so on.  Alternatively, or in
   addition, a client might choose to segregate different kinds of
   vCards to different panes, tabs, or selections in the user
   interface.

Some clients might also make functional distinctions among the
   kinds, ignoring "location" vCards for some purposes and
   considering only "location" vCards for others.

When designing those sorts of visual and functional distinctions,
   client implementations have to decide how to fit unsupported kinds
   into the scheme.  What icon is used for them?  The one for
   "individual"?  A unique one, such as an icon of a question mark?
   Which tab do they go into?  It is beyond the scope of this
   specification to answer these questions, but these are things
   implementers need to consider.

====  XML

Purpose: :: To include extended XML-encoded vCard data in a plain
   vCard.

Value type: :: A single text value.

Cardinality: :: *

Special notes: :: The content of this property is a single XML 1.0
   <<W3C.REC-xml-20081126>> element whose namespace [keyword]#MUST# be explicitly
   specified using the xmlns attribute and [keyword]#MUST NOT# be the vCard 4
   namespace ("urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:vcard-4.0").  (This implies
   that it cannot duplicate a standard vCard property.)  The element
   is to be interpreted as if it was contained in a <vcard> element,
   as defined in <<RFC6351>>.
+
The fragment is subject to normal line folding and escaping, i.e.,
   replace all backslashes with "\\", then replace all newlines with
   "\n", then fold long lines.
+
Support for this property is [keyword]#OPTIONAL#, but implementations of this
   specification [keyword]#MUST# preserve instances of this property when
   propagating vCards.

Value type: :: A single structured text value.  Each component can have
   multiple values.

Cardinality: :: *1

Special note: :: The structured property value corresponds, in
   sequence, to the Family Names (also known as surnames), Given
   Names, Additional Names, Honorific Prefixes, and Honorific
   Suffixes.  The text components are separated by the SEMICOLON
   character (U+003B).  Individual text components can include
   multiple text values separated by the COMMA character (U+002C).
   This property is based on the semantics of the X.520 individual
   name attributes <<CCITT.X520.1988>>.  The property [keyword]#SHOULD# be present

=== Delivery Addressing Properties

==== General

These types are concerned with information related to the delivery
addressing or label for the vCard object.

[[section6_3_1]]
====  ADR

Purpose: :: To specify the components of the delivery address for the
   vCard object.

Value type: :: A single structured text value, separated by the
   SEMICOLON character (U+003B).

Cardinality: :: *

Special notes: :: The structured type value consists of a sequence of
   address components.  The component values [keyword]#MUST# be specified in
   their corresponding position.  The structured type value
   corresponds, in sequence, to
+
[empty]
* the post office box;
* the extended address (e.g., apartment or suite number);
* the street address;
* the locality (e.g., city);
* the region (e.g., state or province);
* the postal code;
* the country name (full name in the language specified in
      <<section5_1>>).

When a component value is missing, the associated component
   separator [keyword]#MUST# still be specified.

Experience with vCard 3 has shown that the first two components
   (post office box and extended address) are plagued with many
   interoperability issues.  To ensure maximal interoperability,
   their values [keyword]#SHOULD# be empty.

The text components are separated by the SEMICOLON character
   (U+003B).  Where it makes semantic sense, individual text
   components can include multiple text values (e.g., a "street"
   component with multiple lines) separated by the COMMA character
   (U+002C).

The property can include the "PREF" parameter to indicate the
   preferred delivery address when more than one address is
   specified.

The GEO and TZ parameters [keyword]#MAY# be used with this property.

The property can also include a "LABEL" parameter to present a
   delivery address label for the address.  Its value is a plain-text
   string representing the formatted address.  Newlines are encoded
   as \n, as they are for property values.

===  Communications Properties

==== General

These properties describe information about how to communicate with
the object the vCard represents.

[[section6_4_1]]
====  TEL

Purpose: :: To specify the telephone number for telephony communication
   with the object the vCard represents.

Value type: :: By default, it is a single free-form text value (for
   backward compatibility with vCard 3), but it [keyword]#SHOULD# be reset to a
   URI value.  It is expected that the URI scheme will be "tel", as
   specified in <<RFC3966>>, but other schemes [keyword]#MAY# be used.

Cardinality: :: *

Special notes: :: This property is based on the X.520 Telephone Number
   attribute <<CCITT.X520.1988>>.
+
The property can include the "PREF" parameter to indicate a
   preferred-use telephone number.
+
The property can include the parameter "TYPE" to specify intended
   use for the telephone number.  The predefined values for the TYPE
   parameter are:

[cols="2"]
|===
| Value     | Description                                           

| text      | Indicates that the telephone number supports text messages (SMS).                                       
| voice     | Indicates a voice telephone number.                   
| fax       | Indicates a facsimile telephone number.               
| cell      | Indicates a cellular or mobile telephone number.      
| video     | Indicates a video conferencing telephone number.      
| pager     | Indicates a paging device telephone number.           
| textphone 
| Indicates a telecommunication device for people with  hearing or speech difficulties.                       
|===

The default type is "voice".  These type parameter values can be
   specified as a parameter list (e.g., TYPE=text;TYPE=voice) or as a
   value list (e.g., TYPE="text,voice").  The default can be
   overridden to another set of values by specifying one or more
   alternate values.  For example, the default TYPE of "voice" can be
   reset to a VOICE and FAX telephone number by the value list
   TYPE="voice,fax".

If this property's value is a URI that can also be used for
   instant messaging, the IMPP (<<section6_4_3>>) property [keyword]#SHOULD# be
   used in addition to this property.

ABNF: ::
+
[source,abnf]
----
  TEL-param = TEL-text-param / TEL-uri-param
  TEL-value = TEL-text-value / TEL-uri-value
    ; Value and parameter MUST match.

  TEL-text-param = "VALUE=text"
  TEL-text-value = text

  TEL-uri-param = "VALUE=uri" / mediatype-param

                 / "pager" / "textphone" / iana-token / x-name
    ; type-param-tel MUST NOT be used with a property other than TEL.

----

Example: ::
+
....
  TEL;VALUE=uri;PREF=1;TYPE="voice,home":tel:+1-555-555-5555;ext=5555
  TEL;VALUE=uri;TYPE=home:tel:+33-01-23-45-67
....

[[section6_4_2]]
====  EMAIL

Purpose: :: To specify the electronic mail address for communication
   with the object the vCard represents.

Value type: :: A single text value.

Cardinality: :: *

Special notes: :: The property can include tye "PREF" parameter to
   indicate a preferred-use email address when more than one is
   specified.
+
Even though the value is free-form UTF-8 text, it is likely to be
   interpreted by a Mail User Agent (MUA) as an "addr-spec", as
   defined in <<RFC5322,section 3.4.1>>.  Readers should also be aware
   of the current work toward internationalized email addresses
   <<RFC5335bis>>.

ABNF: ::
+
[source,abnf]
----
  EMAIL-param = "VALUE=text" / pid-param / pref-param / type-param
              / altid-param / any-param
  EMAIL-value = text
----

Example: ::
+
....

        EMAIL;PREF=1:jane_doe@example.com
....

[[section6_4_3]]
====  IMPP

Purpose: :: To specify the URI for instant messaging and presence
   protocol communications with the object the vCard represents.

Value type: :: A single URI.

Cardinality: :: *

Special notes: :: The property may include the "PREF" parameter to
   indicate that this is a preferred address and has the same
   semantics as the "PREF" parameter in a TEL property.
+
If this property's value is a URI that can be used for voice
and/or video, the TEL property (<<section6_4_1>>) [keyword]#SHOULD# be used in
addition to this property.
+
This property is adapted from <<RFC4770>>, which is made obsolete by
   this document.

ABNF: ::
+
[source,abnf]
----
  IMPP-param = "VALUE=uri" / pid-param / pref-param / type-param
             / mediatype-param / altid-param / any-param
  IMPP-value = URI
----

Example: ::
+

===  Geographical Properties
==== General

These properties are concerned with information associated with
geographical positions or regions associated with the object the
vCard represents.

[[section6_5_1]]
====  TZ

Purpose: :: To specify information related to the time zone of the
   object the vCard represents.

Value type: :: The default is a single text value.  It can also be
   reset to a single URI or utc-offset value.

Cardinality: :: *

Special notes: :: It is expected that names from the public-domain
   Olson database <<TZ-DB>> will be used, but this is not a
   restriction.  See also <<IANA-TZ>>.
+
Efforts are currently being directed at creating a standard URI
   scheme for expressing time zone information.  Usage of such a
   scheme would ensure a high level of interoperability between
   implementations that support it.
+
Note that utc-offset values [keyword]#SHOULD NOT# be used because the UTC
   offset varies with time -- not just because of the usual daylight
   saving time shifts that occur in may regions, but often entire
   regions will "re-base" their overall offset.  The actual offset
   may be +/- 1 hour (or perhaps a little more) than the one given.

ABNF: ::
+
[source,abnf]
----
  TZ-param = "VALUE=" ("text" / "uri" / "utc-offset")
  TZ-value = text / URI / utc-offset
    ; Value and parameter MUST match.

  TZ-param =/ altid-param / pid-param / pref-param / type-param
            / mediatype-param / any-param
----

Examples: ::
+
....
  TZ:Raleigh/North America

  TZ;VALUE=utc-offset:-0500
    ; Note: utc-offset format is NOT RECOMMENDED.
....

[[section6_5_2]]
====  GEO

Purpose: :: To specify information related to the global positioning of
   the object the vCard represents.

Value type: :: A single URI.

Cardinality: ::  *

Special notes: :: The "geo" URI scheme <<RFC5870>> is particularly well
   suited for this property, but other schemes [keyword]#MAY# be used.


ABNF: ::
+

----
  GEO-param = "VALUE=uri" / pid-param / pref-param / type-param
            / mediatype-param / altid-param / any-param

Value type: :: A single text value.

Cardinality: :: *

Special notes:  This property is based on the X.520 Business Category
   explanatory attribute <<CCITT.X520.1988>>.  This property is
   included as an organizational type to avoid confusion with the
   semantics of the TITLE property and incorrect usage of that
   property when the semantics of this property is intended.

ABNF: ::
+
[source,abnf]
----
  ROLE-param = "VALUE=text" / language-param / pid-param / pref-param
             / type-param / altid-param / any-param

====  UID

Purpose: :: To specify a value that represents a globally unique
   identifier corresponding to the entity associated with the vCard.

Value type: :: A single URI value.  It [keyword]#MAY# also be reset to free-form
   text.

Cardinality: :: *1

Special notes: :: This property is used to uniquely identify the object
   that the vCard represents.  The "uuid" URN namespace defined in
   <<RFC4122>> is particularly well suited to this task, but other URI
   schemes [keyword]#MAY# be used.  Free-form text [keyword]#MAY# also be used.

===  Extended Properties and Parameters

The properties and parameters defined by this document can be
extended.  Non-standard, private properties and parameters with a
name starting with "X-" may be defined bilaterally between two
cooperating agents without outside registration or standardization.

[[section7]]
==  Synchronization
=== General

vCard data often needs to be synchronized between devices.  In this
context, synchronization is defined as the intelligent merging of two
representations of the same object. vCard 4.0 includes mechanisms to
aid this process.

[[section7_1]]
===  Mechanisms

==== General

Two mechanisms are available: the UID property is used to match
multiple instances of the same vCard, while the PID parameter is used
to match multiple instances of the same property.

The term "matching" is used here to mean recognizing that two
instances are in fact representations of the same object.  For
example, a single vCard that is shared with someone results in two
vCard instances.  After they have evolved separately, they still
represent the same object, and therefore may be matched by a
synchronization engine.

[[section7_1_1]]
====  Matching vCard Instances

vCard instances for which the UID properties (<<section6_7_6>>) are
equivalent [keyword]#MUST# be matched.  Equivalence is determined as specified
in <<RFC3986,section 6>>.

In all other cases, vCard instances [keyword]#MAY# be matched at the discretion
of the synchronization engine.

[[section7_1_2]]
====  Matching Property Instances

Property instances belonging to unmatched vCards [keyword]#MUST NOT# be matched.

Property instances whose name (e.g., EMAIL, TEL, etc.) is not the
same [keyword]#MUST NOT# be matched.

Property instances whose name is CLIENTPIDMAP are handled separately
and [keyword]#MUST NOT# be matched.  The synchronization [keyword]#MUST# ensure that there
is consistency of CLIENTPIDMAPs among matched vCard instances.

Property instances belonging to matched vCards, whose name is the
same, and whose maximum cardinality is 1, [keyword]#MUST# be matched.

Property instances belonging to matched vCards, whose name is the
same, and whose PID parameters match, [keyword]#MUST# be matched.  See
<<section7_1_3>> for details on PID matching.

In all other cases, property instances [keyword]#MAY# be matched at the
discretion of the synchronization engine.

[[section7_1_3]]
====  PID Matching

Two PID values for which the first fields are equivalent represent
the same local value.

Two PID values representing the same local value and for which the
second fields point to CLIENTPIDMAP properties whose second field
URIs are equivalent (as specified in <<RFC3986,section 6>>) also
represent the same global value.

PID parameters for which at least one pair of their values represent
the same global value [keyword]#MUST# be matched.

In all other cases, PID parameters [keyword]#MAY# be matched at the discretion
of the synchronization engine.

For example, PID value "5.1", in the first vCard below, and PID value
"5.2", in the second vCard below, represent the same global value.


....
  BEGIN:VCARD
  VERSION:4.0
  EMAIL;PID=4.2,5.1:jdoe@example.com
  CLIENTPIDMAP:1;urn:uuid:3eef374e-7179-4196-a914-27358c3e6527
  CLIENTPIDMAP:2;urn:uuid:42bcd5a7-1699-4514-87b4-056edf68e9cc
  END:VCARD
....

....
  BEGIN:VCARD
  VERSION:4.0
  EMAIL;PID=5.1,5.2:john@example.com
  CLIENTPIDMAP:1;urn:uuid:0c75c629-6a8d-4d5e-a07f-1bb35846854d
  CLIENTPIDMAP:2;urn:uuid:3eef374e-7179-4196-a914-27358c3e6527
  END:VCARD
....

[[section7_2]]
===  Example

[[section7_2_1]]
====  Creation

The following simple vCard is first created on a given device.

....
  BEGIN:VCARD
  VERSION:4.0
  UID:urn:uuid:4fbe8971-0bc3-424c-9c26-36c3e1eff6b1
  FN;PID=1.1:J. Doe
  N:Doe;J.;;;
  EMAIL;PID=1.1:jdoe@example.com
  CLIENTPIDMAP:1;urn:uuid:53e374d9-337e-4727-8803-a1e9c14e0556
  END:VCARD
....

This new vCard is assigned the UID
"urn:uuid:4fbe8971-0bc3-424c-9c26-36c3e1eff6b1" by the creating
device.  The FN and EMAIL properties are assigned the same local
value of 1, and this value is given global context by associating it
with "urn:uuid:53e374d9-337e-4727-8803-a1e9c14e0556", which
represents the creating device.  We are at liberty to reuse the same
local value since instances of different properties will never be
matched.  The N property has no PID because it is forbidden by its
maximum cardinality of 1.

[[section7_2_2]]
====  Initial Sharing

This vCard is shared with a second device.  Upon inspecting the UID
property, the second device understands that this is a new vCard
(i.e., unmatched) and thus the synchronization results in a simple
copy.

[[section7_2_3]]
====  Adding and Sharing a Property

A new phone number is created on the first device, then the vCard is
shared with the second device.  This is what the second device
receives:

....
  BEGIN:VCARD
  VERSION:4.0
  UID:urn:uuid:4fbe8971-0bc3-424c-9c26-36c3e1eff6b1
  FN;PID=1.1:J. Doe
  N:Doe;J.;;;
  EMAIL;PID=1.1:jdoe@example.com
  TEL;PID=1.1;VALUE=uri:tel:+1-555-555-5555
  CLIENTPIDMAP:1;urn:uuid:53e374d9-337e-4727-8803-a1e9c14e0556
  END:VCARD
....

Upon inspecting the UID property, the second device matches the vCard
it received to the vCard that it already has stored.  It then starts
comparing the properties of the two vCards in same-named pairs.

The FN properties are matched because the PID parameters have the
same global value.  Since the property value is the same, no update
takes place.

The N properties are matched automatically because their maximum
cardinality is 1.  Since the property value is the same, no update
takes place.

The EMAIL properties are matched because the PID parameters have the
same global value.  Since the property value is the same, no update
takes place.

The TEL property in the new vCard is not matched to any in the stored
vCard because no property in the stored vCard has the same name.
Therefore, this property is copied from the new vCard to the stored
vCard.

The CLIENTPIDMAP property is handled separately by the
synchronization engine.  It ensures that it is consistent with the
stored one.  If it was not, the results would be up to the
synchronization engine, and thus undefined by this document.

[[section7_2_4]]
====  Simultaneous Editing

A new email address and a new phone number are added to the vCard on
each of the two devices, and then a new synchronization event
happens.  Here are the vCards that are communicated to each other:

....
  BEGIN:VCARD
  VERSION:4.0
  UID:urn:uuid:4fbe8971-0bc3-424c-9c26-36c3e1eff6b1
  FN;PID=1.1:J. Doe
  N:Doe;J.;;;
  EMAIL;PID=1.1:jdoe@example.com
  EMAIL;PID=2.1:boss@example.com
  TEL;PID=1.1;VALUE=uri:tel:+1-555-555-5555
  TEL;PID=2.1;VALUE=uri:tel:+1-666-666-6666
  CLIENTPIDMAP:1;urn:uuid:53e374d9-337e-4727-8803-a1e9c14e0556
  END:VCARD
....

....
  BEGIN:VCARD
  VERSION:4.0
  UID:urn:uuid:4fbe8971-0bc3-424c-9c26-36c3e1eff6b1
  FN;PID=1.1:J. Doe
  N:Doe;J.;;;
  EMAIL;PID=1.1:jdoe@example.com
  EMAIL;PID=2.2:ceo@example.com
  TEL;PID=1.1;VALUE=uri:tel:+1-555-555-5555
  TEL;PID=2.2;VALUE=uri:tel:+1-666-666-6666
  CLIENTPIDMAP:1;urn:uuid:53e374d9-337e-4727-8803-a1e9c14e0556
  CLIENTPIDMAP:2;urn:uuid:1f762d2b-03c4-4a83-9a03-75ff658a6eee
  END:VCARD
....

On the first device, the same PID source identifier (1) is reused for
the new EMAIL and TEL properties.  On the second device, a new source
identifier (2) is generated, and a corresponding CLIENTPIDMAP
property is created.  It contains the second device's identifier,
"urn:uuid:1f762d2b-03c4-4a83-9a03-75ff658a6eee".

The new EMAIL properties are unmatched on both sides since the PID
global value is new in both cases.  The sync thus results in a copy
on both sides.

Although the situation appears to be the same for the TEL properties,
in this case, the synchronization engine is particularly smart and
matches the two new TEL properties even though their PID global
values are different.  Note that in this case, the rules of
<<section7_1_2>> state that two properties [keyword]#MAY# be matched at the
discretion of the synchronization engine.  Therefore, the two
properties are merged.

All this results in the following vCard, which is stored on both
devices:


....
  BEGIN:VCARD
  VERSION:4.0
  UID:urn:uuid:4fbe8971-0bc3-424c-9c26-36c3e1eff6b1
  FN:J. Doe
  N:Doe;J.;;;
  EMAIL;PID=1.1:jdoe@example.com
  EMAIL;PID=2.1:boss@example.com
  EMAIL;PID=2.2:ceo@example.com
  TEL;PID=1.1;VALUE=uri:tel:+1-555-555-5555
  TEL;PID=2.1,2.2;VALUE=uri:tel:+1-666-666-6666
  CLIENTPIDMAP:1;urn:uuid:53e374d9-337e-4727-8803-a1e9c14e0556
  CLIENTPIDMAP:2;urn:uuid:1f762d2b-03c4-4a83-9a03-75ff658a6eee
  END:VCARD
....

[[section7_2_5]]
====  Global Context Simplification

The two devices finish their synchronization procedure by simplifying
their global contexts.  Since they haven't talked to any other
device, the following vCard is for all purposes equivalent to the
above.  It is also shorter.

....
  BEGIN:VCARD
  VERSION:4.0
  UID:urn:uuid:4fbe8971-0bc3-424c-9c26-36c3e1eff6b1
  FN:J. Doe
  N:Doe;J.;;;
  EMAIL;PID=1.1:jdoe@example.com
  EMAIL;PID=2.1:boss@example.com
  EMAIL;PID=3.1:ceo@example.com
  TEL;PID=1.1;VALUE=uri:tel:+1-555-555-5555
  TEL;PID=2.1;VALUE=uri:tel:+1-666-666-6666
  CLIENTPIDMAP:1;urn:uuid:53e374d9-337e-4727-8803-a1e9c14e0556
  END:VCARD
....

The details of global context simplification are unspecified by this
document.  They are left up to the synchronization engine.  This
example is merely intended to illustrate the possibility, which
investigating would be, in the author's opinion, worthwhile.

[[section9]]
==  Security Considerations

* Internet mail is often used to transport vCards and is subject to
   many well-known security attacks, including monitoring, replay,
   and forgery.  Care should be taken by any directory service in
   allowing information to leave the scope of the service itself,
   where any access controls or confidentiality can no longer be
   guaranteed.  Applications should also take care to display
   directory data in a "safe" environment.

*  vCards can carry cryptographic keys or certificates, as described
   in <<section6_8_1>>.

*  vCards often carry information that can be sensitive (e.g.,
   birthday, address, and phone information).  Although vCards have
   no inherent authentication or confidentiality provisions, they can
   easily be carried by any security mechanism that transfers MIME
   objects to address authentication or confidentiality (e.g., S/MIME
   <<RFC5751>>, OpenPGP <<RFC4880>>).  In cases where the confidentiality
   or authenticity of information contained in vCard is a concern,
   the vCard [keyword]#SHOULD# be transported using one of these secure
   mechanisms.  The KEY property (<<section6_8_1>>) can be used to
   transport the public key used by these mechanisms.

*  The information in a vCard may become out of date.  In cases where
   the vitality of data is important to an originator of a vCard, the
   SOURCE property (<<section6_1_3>>) [keyword]#SHOULD# be specified.  In addition,
   the "REV" type described in <<section6_7_4>> can be specified to
   indicate the last time that the vCard data was updated.

*  Many vCard properties may be used to transport URIs.  Please refer
   to <<RFC3986,section 7>>, for considerations related to URIs.

[[section10]]
== IANA Considerations

[[section10_1]]
===  Media Type Registration

IANA has registered the following Media Type (in
http://www.iana.org) and marked the text/directory Media Type as
DEPRECATED.

To: :: \ietf-types@iana.org

Subject: :: Registration of media type text/vcard

Type name: :: text

Subtype name: :: vcard

Required parameters: :: none

Optional parameters: :: version
+
The "version" parameter is to be interpreted identically as the
   VERSION vCard property.  If this parameter is present, all vCards
   in a text/vcard body part [keyword]#MUST# have a VERSION property with value
   identical to that of this MIME parameter.
+
"charset": as defined for text/plain <<RFC2046>>; encodings other
   than UTF-8 <<RFC3629>> [keyword]#MUST NOT# be used.

Encoding considerations: :: 8bit

Security considerations: :: See <<section9>>.

Interoperability considerations: :: The text/vcard media type is
   intended to identify vCard data of any version.  There are older
   specifications of vCard <<RFC2426>> <<vCard21>> still in common use.
   While these formats are similar, they are not strictly compatible.
   In general, it is necessary to inspect the value of the VERSION
   property (see <<section6_7_9>>) for identifying the standard to which
   a given vCard object conforms.

===  Registering New vCard Elements

==== General

This section defines the process for registering new or modified
vCard elements (i.e., properties, parameters, value data types, and
values) with IANA.

[[section10_2_1]]
====  Registration Procedure

The IETF has created a mailing list, \vcarddav@ietf.org, which can be
used for public discussion of vCard element proposals prior to
registration.  Use of the mailing list is strongly encouraged.  The
IESG has appointed a designated expert who will monitor the
\vcarddav@ietf.org mailing list and review registrations.

Registration of new vCard elements [keyword]#MUST# be reviewed by the designated
expert and published in an RFC.  A Standards Track RFC is [keyword]#REQUIRED#
for the registration of new value data types that modify existing
properties.  A Standards Track RFC is also [keyword]#REQUIRED# for registration
of vCard elements that modify vCard elements previously documented in
a Standards Track RFC.

The registration procedure begins when a completed registration
template, defined in the sections below, is sent to \vcarddav@ietf.org
and \iana@iana.org.  Within two weeks, the designated expert is
expected to tell IANA and the submitter of the registration whether
the registration is approved, approved with minor changes, or
rejected with cause.  When a registration is rejected with cause, it
can be re-submitted if the concerns listed in the cause are
addressed.  Decisions made by the designated expert can be appealed
to the IESG Applications Area Director, then to the IESG.  They
follow the normal appeals procedure for IESG decisions.

Once the registration procedure concludes successfully, IANA creates
or modifies the corresponding record in the vCard registry.  The
completed registration template is discarded.

An RFC specifying new vCard elements [keyword]#MUST# include the completed
registration templates, which [keyword]#MAY# be expanded with additional
information.  These completed templates are intended to go in the
body of the document, not in the IANA Considerations section.

Finally, note that there is an XML representation for vCard defined
in <<RFC6351>>.  An XML representation [keyword]#SHOULD# be defined for new vCard
elements.

[[section10_2_2]]
====  Vendor Namespace

The vendor namespace is used for vCard elements associated with
commercially available products.  "Vendor" or "producer" are
construed as equivalent and very broadly in this context.

A registration may be placed in the vendor namespace by anyone who
needs to interchange files associated with the particular product.
However, the registration formally belongs to the vendor or
organization handling the vCard elements in the namespace being
registered.  Changes to the specification will be made at their
request, as discussed in subsequent sections.

vCard elements belonging to the vendor namespace will be
distinguished by the "VND-" prefix.  This is followed by an IANA-
registered Private Enterprise Number (PEN), a dash, and a vCard
element designation of the vendor's choosing (e.g., "VND-123456-
MUDPIE").

While public exposure and review of vCard elements to be registered
in the vendor namespace are not required, using the \vcarddav@ietf.org
mailing list for review is strongly encouraged to improve the quality
of those specifications.  Registrations in the vendor namespace may
be submitted directly to the IANA.

[[section10_2_3]]
====  Registration Template for Properties

A property is defined by completing the following template.

Namespace: :: Empty for the global namespace, "VND-NNNN-" for a vendor-
   specific property (where NNNN is replaced by the vendor's PEN).

Property name: :: The name of the property.

Purpose: :: The purpose of the property.  Give a short but clear
   description.

Value type: :: Any of the valid value types for the property value
   needs to be specified.  The default value type also needs to be
   specified.

Cardinality: :: See <<section6>>.

Property parameters: :: Any of the valid property parameters for the
   property [keyword]#MUST# be specified.

Description: :: Any special notes about the property, how it is to be
   used, etc.

Format definition: :: The ABNF for the property definition needs to be
   specified.

Example(s): :: One or more examples of instances of the property need
   to be specified.

[[section10_2_4]]
====  Registration Template for Parameters

A parameter is defined by completing the following template.

Namespace: :: Empty for the global namespace, "VND-NNNN-" for a vendor-
   specific property (where NNNN is replaced by the vendor's PEN).

Parameter name: :: The name of the parameter.

Purpose: :: The purpose of the parameter.  Give a short but clear
   description.

Description: :: Any special notes about the parameter, how it is to be
   used, etc.

Format definition: :: The ABNF for the parameter definition needs to be
   specified.

Example(s): :: One or more examples of instances of the parameter need
   to be specified.

[[section10_2_5]]
====  Registration Template for Value Data Types

A value data type is defined by completing the following template.

Value name: :: The name of the value type.

Purpose: :: The purpose of the value type.  Give a short but clear
   description.

Description: :: Any special notes about the value type, how it is to be
   used, etc.

Format definition: :: The ABNF for the value type definition needs to
   be specified.

Example(s): :: One or more examples of instances of the value type need
   to be specified.

[[section10_2_6]]
====  Registration Template for Values

A value is defined by completing the following template.

Value: :: The value literal.

Purpose: :: The purpose of the value.  Give a short but clear
   description.

Conformance: :: The vCard properties and/or parameters that can take
   this value needs to be specified.

Example(s): :: One or more examples of instances of the value need to
   be specified.

The following is a fictitious example of a registration of a vCard
value:

Value: :: supervisor

Purpose: :: It means that the related entity is the direct hierarchical
   superior (i.e., supervisor or manager) of the entity this vCard
   represents.

Conformance: :: This value can be used with the "TYPE" parameter
   applied on the "RELATED" property.


Example(s): ::
+
....
RELATED;TYPE=supervisor:urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6
....

[[appendixA]]
[appendix]
== Differences from RFCs 2425 and 2426

This appendix contains a high-level overview of the major changes
that have been made in the vCard specification from <<RFC2425>> and
<<RFC2426>>.  It is incomplete, as it only lists the most important changes.

[[appendixA_1]]
===  New Structure

*  <<RFC2425>> and <<RFC2426>> have been merged.

*  vCard is now not only a MIME type but a stand-alone format.

*  A proper MIME type registration form has been included.

*  UTF-8 is now the only possible character set.

*  New vCard elements can be registered from IANA.

[[appendixA_2]]
===  Removed Features

*  The CONTEXT and CHARSET parameters are no more.

*  The NAME, MAILER, LABEL, and CLASS properties are no more.

*  The "intl", "dom", "postal", and "parcel" TYPE parameter values
   for the ADR property have been removed.

*  In-line vCards (such as the value of the AGENT property) are no
   longer supported.

[[appendixA_3]]
===  New Properties and Parameters

*  The KIND, GENDER, LANG, ANNIVERSARY, XML, and CLIENTPIDMAP
   properties have been added.

*  <<RFC2739>>, which defines the FBURL, CALADRURI, CAPURI, and CALURI
   properties, has been merged in.

*  <<RFC4770>>, which defines the IMPP property, has been merged in.

*  The "work" and "home" TYPE parameter values are now applicable to
   many more properties.

*  The "pref" value of the TYPE parameter is now a parameter of its
   own, with a positive integer value indicating the level of
   preference.

*  The ALTID and PID parameters have been added.

*  The MEDIATYPE parameter has been added and replaces the TYPE
   parameter when it was used for indicating the media type of the
   property's content.
